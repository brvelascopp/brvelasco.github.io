		>It is without a doubt that we the citizens of the Philippines have one of the best governments in all of  Asia. Not to mention, it even has the most competent president, none other than President Rodrigo Duterte  and its administration. Everything the government has been doing all this time has been very beneficial for  the country.

		Especially during this time of pandemic, the government had been taking measures to the extreme.  Like that one time where they didn’t implement a flight ban as soon as the outbreak started. The outbreak  first began last December of 2019, but the flight ban was implemented in March of 2020; making that 2  months late. A rather quick response time if you ask me. Because of which, the number of covid19 patients  had been lowered.

		The government has many competent politicians. They’ve had their parts in contributing in the  pandemic. Some have violated quarantine protocols and catching the virus itself and possibly even infecting  some other people. Example of which is Senator Koko Pimentel. Not only that, other people with higher status abuse citizens that violated the curfew. This happened on April 7 in Mexico, Pampanga, where the barangay  official forced three LGBTQ+ people to perform humiliating acts as a punishment.

		Almost all of the government funds are going to other purposes rather than the fight against the  pandemic. But it’s no big no deal, after all this pandemic is not big of a problem at all. It’s better off going to  the military or on the hands of other corrupt politicians. That way the funds are not going to waste. The  government’s debt has reached almost 9.615 trillion dollars, but instead of paying them, they make use of  the money very wisely. Just like how they used 389 million pesos for the revamp of Manila Bay. Spending  the funds on many very important matters instead of the pandemic is a good solution for the fight against  COVID19.

		Just like what spokesperson Harry Roque said, we beat the UP’s prediction for the number of covid19 cases. Their prediction was that there will be 40,000 cases of covid19 by the end of June, but only ended up  with 36,438 cases. That must mean the Philippines is winning against the pandemic.

		In order to win against this pandemic, we must make some solutions. One, we should have a faster  response. Instead of being 2 months late, we should at least wait half a year. Two, we should make horrid  punishments for the violators of the curfew. Punishments that abuse their human rights. This way, they  would not dare to cause any violations. Three, use the government’s funds on other important matters than  the pandemic. Four, beat the UP’s prediction again. This can be done in many ways, but the most effective  would be to get rid of the patients infected with the virus. With all of these solutions, then surely, we will win  the fight against the pandemic.
